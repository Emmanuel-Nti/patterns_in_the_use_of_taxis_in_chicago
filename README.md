|I work for the online store Ice, which sells video games all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data 
on game sales are available from open sources. I need to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This will allow me to spot potential big winners 
and plan advertising campaigns; imagining that it’s December 2016 and I'm planning a campaign for 2017. | *pandas*, *matplotlib.pyplot*, *numpy*, *seaborn*, *scipy*, *missingno*, *io*, *requests* | Practicum by Yandex |
